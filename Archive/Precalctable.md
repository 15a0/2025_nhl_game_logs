	OK, you might need to think back a bit but I have a question. Consider this new proposal: a hypothetical table team,(13 columns of seasonal high signal stats), (13 columns last x games of same stats). Now contrast that with the current GOI model. We start that using a TPI where we calculate the season to date 13 high signal stats for every team, then convert those to zscores. Then we go from that TPI (all teams) to the GOI for the slate of a couple games. So my question is: Do we still NEED full season stats for the 13 states and zscores for every team? Or put another way did our GOI evolve from (as a by product that TPI). NO code this is just theory and design

**SHORT ANSWER:** **YES — you still need full-season stats and league-wide z-scores.** **BUT** — you can **refactor GOI** so that **TPI is no longer a required _input_** — it becomes a **byproduct** of your **new game-level data engine**.

Let’s unpack this **design evolution** cleanly.

---

## Current GOI Flow (TPI → GOI)

text

```
[All Teams: Season Stats]
        ↓
[13 Stats → Z-scores vs. League] → TPI (Team Performance Index)
        ↓
[Slate Teams Only] → GOI = f(TPI, Recent Form, Matchup)
```

### Why TPI Exists

- **Z-scores require league context** → CF% = 55% means nothing unless you know the **league average is 50%**
- **GOI needs relative strength** → “Is FLA good?” → Compare to all 32 teams

**TPI is the normalization layer.**

---

## New Proposal: Game-Level → Season + Last X → GOI

text

```
[Game-Level Data]
        ↓
[Per Team: Season 13 Stats] + [Last X: 13 Stats]
        ↓
[League-Wide Z-scores (auto-computed)]
        ↓
GOI = f(Season Z, Last X Z, Matchup, Venue)
```

### Key Shift:

> **TPI is no longer an input.** **TPI is now an output.**

## Do You Still Need Full-Season Stats & Z-Scores?

|Question|Answer|Why|
|---|---|---|
|**Do you need full-season 13 stats?**|YES|To compute **league averages and std devs** for z-scores|
|**Do you need z-scores?**|YES|To compare teams fairly (55% CF% vs. 48% only matters in context)|
|**Do you need TPI as a separate step?**|NO|It’s now **automatically generated** from your game data|

---

## The Evolution: From Byproduct → Core Engine

|Version|TPI Role|Data Source|Automation|
|---|---|---|---|
|**v1 (Current)**|Required input|Spreadsheets|Manual|
|**v2 (Proposed)**|Auto-generated|Game-level API|Fully automated|

> **TPI didn’t go away — it moved _upstream_.**

## Refactored GOI Architecture (No Code)

text

```
1. Ingest all games (via schedule.csv + boxscore/pbp)
2. For every team:
   - Season 13 stats
   - Last X games 13 stats
3. Compute league-wide:
   - Mean & SD for each of 13 stats
4. Z-score every team (season + last X)
5. GOI = weighted blend:
   - 40% Season Z-score
   - 50% Last X Z-score
   - 10% Slate context (opp, venue, rest)
```

**TPI = Step 4** **GOI = Step 5**

---

## Why You _Cannot_ Skip League Context

|Stat|Team A|Team B|Who’s Better?|
|---|---|---|---|
|CF%|52%|51%|?|
|**With z-scores**|+1.2σ|+0.8σ|**A is clearly better**|

> **Raw stats lie. Z-scores tell the truth.**

---

## The Win: **TPI Becomes a Feature, Not a Dependency**

|Before|After|
|---|---|
|“I need TPI spreadsheet”|“System auto-computes TPI”|
|Update weekly|Updates nightly|
|Risk of stale data|Always current|
|Manual merge|Zero touch|

---

## GOI v2 Formula (Conceptual)

text

```
GOI = 
  0.4 × Z_Season(13_stats) 
+ 0.5 × Z_LastX(13_stats) 
+ 0.1 × Context_Score
```

Where:

- Z_Season = average z-score of 13 stats (season)
- Z_LastX = same, but last X games
- Context_Score = (Home? +0.5) + (vs. bad PK? +1.0) + etc.

---

## Final Design Answer

> **Did GOI evolve from TPI as a byproduct?** **YES — in v1.** **In v2 — TPI evolves into a _core computation_, not a prerequisite.**

You’re not eliminating TPI. You’re **promoting it** from **manual input** to **automated truth**.

---

## Your New Superpower

|Input|Output|
|---|---|
|schedule.csv + game IDs|**Full league TPI + Last X + GOI**|
|1 line: slate = ["FLA", "NJD", "COL"]|**Slate-ranked stacks in 3 seconds**|

---

## When You’re Ready

Say:

> **“Show me GOI v2 formula + sample output (no code)”**

I’ll give you:

- Exact 13-stat z-score blend
- Sample TPI → GOI table
- Slate prioritization logic

You’re not replacing GOI. You’re **upgrading it into a self-sustaining intelligence engine**.

**This is the future.** And you’re building it.
