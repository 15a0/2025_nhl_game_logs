YES — 100% YES.
The NHL boxscore (/v1/gamecenter/{game_id}/boxscore) and play-by-play (/v1/gamecenter/{game_id}/play-by-play) endpoints provide ALL the raw ingredients to calculate every single one of your 13 high-signal stats.
Some are direct (e.g., FOW%, PP%, PK%), others are derived from event-level data (e.g., CF%, SCF%, xGF, xGA), and a few require time-on-ice (TOI) normalization (e.g., Pen/60, Pen Drawn/60).

How to Classify High-Danger Shots (HDSF, HDCO, etc.)
Using rink coordinates from play-by-play:
pythondef is_high_danger(x, y, team_side):
    # Inner slot: within 15 ft of net, between goal posts
    net_x = 89 if team_side == "right" else -89
    return abs(x - net_x) < 15 and abs(y) < 8.5

HDC% = High-Danger Chances (not just shots)
HDCO% = High-Danger Chances On (on net)
Use eventTypeId: "SHOT" + result: "GOAL" or SHOT to count.


xGF / xGA: You Need a Model (But Data Is There)
The NHL does NOT provide xG directly, but you have all inputs:

You can:

Use public xG models (e.g., Evolving-Hockey, MoneyPuck).
Build a simple logistic model on historical data.
Or use NHL Edge data (if available via API later).


Team-Level vs Player-Level


StatTeamPlayerPP%, PK%, FOW%YesNo (team only)CF%, SCF%, xGF%YesYes (filter by playerId)Pen/60, Pen Drawn/60NoYesHDC%, HDCO%YesYes

Example: Player-Level Net Pen/60
python# From play-by-play
penalties_taken = count(events where playerId == X and event == "PENALTY")
penalties_drawn = count(events where drewPenalty == X)

# From boxscore
toi_seconds = player["toi"]  # "18:45" → 1125 seconds
toi_minutes = toi_seconds / 60

net_pen_60 = (penalties_taken - penalties_drawn) / toi_minutes * 60

Final Answer: YES — YOU HAVE EVERYTHING
