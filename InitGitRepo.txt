Goal
Set up your current local folder as the Git repo linked to the new GitHub remote.

I’ll give you one command at a time. Run each, then tell me when it’s done (and paste any errors).

Assumptions
GitHub repo: https://github.com/15a0/2025_nhl_game_logs.git
You’re currently in the local folder you want to use.
Step 1 — Initialize the repo (main branch)
Run:

git init -b main
If your Git version doesn’t support -b, use:
git init
git branch -M main

Step 2 — Add the GitHub remote
Run:

git remote add origin https://github.com/15a0/2025_nhl_game_logs.git
If you see “remote origin already exists”, use:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/15a0/2025_nhl_game_logs.git
