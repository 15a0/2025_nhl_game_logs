Let’s walk through the vision, the upgrade path, and the massive edge you unlock by eliminating spreadsheets entirely.

Current State: Spreadsheet-Dependent GOI


InputSourcePain PointsSeason stats (CF%, xGF, etc.)Manual spreadsheetsStale, error-prone, time-consumingLast N gamesCopy-paste or mergeInconsistent, breaks easilyGOI calculationStatic formula in ExcelRigid, not slate-aware
You’re hand-feeding the model.

Future State: API → Game-Level → Dynamic GOI
textNHL API 
    → Game-by-game boxscore + play-by-play 
        → 13 high-signal stats per game 
            → Aggregate: Season + Last 5 + Last 10 
                → GOI = f(Season, Recent, Matchup, Venue)
No spreadsheets. No manual updates. No lag.

The Refactored GOI: Three-Layer Intelligence



LayerInputWeightPurpose1. Season BaselineFull season 13 stats40%True talent2. Form (Last Y Games)Rolling window50%Hot/cold streaks3. Slate ContextOpponent, venue, rest10%Game-specific edge

→ Not just “good team” — “good team, on fire, at home vs. bad PK”

The GOI Formula (Refactored — No Code)
textGOI = 
    0.4 × normalize(Season_13_Stats) 
  + 0.5 × normalize(Last_Y_13_Stats) 
  + 0.1 × (Venue_Boost + Rest_Boost + PPvPK_Mismatch)
Where:

normalize() = z-score or percentile rank across league
PPvPK_Mismatch = Team PP% - Opp PK% (if > 20 → +1.0, etc.)


Slate Output (Your Dream Dashboard)
For a 2-game slate:
textSLATE GOI REPORT — Oct 27, 2025
════════════════════════════════════════
TEAM     | SEASON GOI | LAST 5 GOI | SLATE GOI | EDGE vs OPP | STACK?
FLA      | 51.2       | 58.1       | 56.8      | +2.9        | YES (L1+D)

CHI      | 47.1       | 46.8       | 46.5      | -1.8        | NO
One glance → two stacks → done.

The Path Forward (No Code, Just Milestones)


MilestoneWhat You Get1. Per-game 13 statsDone (you have it)2. Season aggregatorSum/avg all games per team3. Rolling window (Last Y)Filter by date, recompute4. GOI v2 calculatorWeighted, dynamic, slate-aware5. Slate input → report“Give me GOI for tonight’s 3 games”

The Edge Math (Conservative)

That’s the difference between breaking even and printing money.


Final Thought: You’re Building a DFS Operating System
You’re not just calculating GOI.
You’re building:

A data pipeline (API → stats)
A signal engine (13 stats → GOI)
A decision layer (slate → stacks)
