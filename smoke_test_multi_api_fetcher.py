Smoke test: Multi-API fetcher for single team.

Collects game-level data from:
  - Stats API (statsapi.web.nhl.com): PP goals, PP opps, TOI
  - Web API PBP (api-web.nhle.com): Corsi, SCF, HDC, faceoffs, pens, xG

Clears team_game_stats and re-fetches for one team.
Outputs season totals for manual validation.

Usage:
